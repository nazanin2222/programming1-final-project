## Project Description
This project simulates a University Management System that manages students, courses, departments, assignments, and addresses. 
Also demonstrates OOP concepts including classes, enums, encapsulation, constructors, static fields, and relationships between objects.

### Key Classes
- **Address** – Stores address details with Canadian postal code validation.  
- **Department** – Represents academic departments with auto-generated IDs and name validation.  
- **Student** – Manages student information, course registration, and assignment scores.  
- **Assignment** – Manages assignment details and calculates student scores.  
- **Course** – Manages courses, assignments, student registration, and grade calculations.  
- **Util** – Contains helper methods such as converting strings to title case.  

> **Note:** Simple getters, setters, `toString()`, and `equals()` methods are implemented using Lombok

## Features
1. Automatic ID generation for students, departments, courses, and assignments.  
2. Validation for postal codes and department names.  
3. Course registration and dropping functionality for students.  
4. Assignment score generation with randomization rules.  
5. Weighted average calculation for student scores.  
6. Display of course scores and averages.  
7. Utility methods for string formatting.  
8. Unit tests for user-defined methods.
